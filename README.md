# Kleur

## Dark, tonal, beautiful

**Also known as `kleurskema` on npm. Currently in heavy dev.**

Kleur is a (dark only for now) color scheme based on
[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) and [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com).
It's designed to be:

- Minimal. Very few colours are used, and they're designed to be used tonally.
- Beautiful. What's the use of a colourscheme if it doesn't work?
- Easy to read. Colours are AAA WCA certified for base, surface, overlay, and
  text. Tonal colours are based on the base colour mixed in with the tone, so
  they're easy to read too.
